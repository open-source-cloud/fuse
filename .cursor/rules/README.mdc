## Cursor Skills

Comprehensive Go senior developer skills are available in `.cursor/skills/`:

- **go-senior-developer/** - Go best practices, SOLID principles, clean code
- **microservices-architecture/** - Microservices patterns and practices
- **ddd-patterns/** - Domain-Driven Design patterns
- **clean-hexagonal-architecture/** - Clean and hexagonal architecture
- **cqrs-event-driven/** - CQRS and event-driven architecture
- **go-concurrency/** - Go concurrency patterns and best practices
- **actor-model-patterns/** - Actor model patterns with ergo.services

## Spec-Kit Integration

The project uses spec-kit for spec-driven development:

- `.specify/memory/constitution.md` - Project constitution and governing principles
- `.specify/templates/` - Spec-kit templates (spec, plan, tasks)
- `.specify/scripts/` - Spec-kit automation scripts
- `.cursor/commands/speckit.*` - Spec-kit slash commands

Use `/speckit.constitution`, `/speckit.specify`, `/speckit.plan`, `/speckit.tasks`, and `/speckit.implement` commands for structured development.

## Using These Rules

### In Cursor

Cursor will automatically load and index all `.mdc` files in this directory. You can:

1. **Reference specific topics**: Ask about specific patterns (e.g., "Show me the actor factory pattern")
2. **Get contextual help**: Cursor will provide relevant rules based on your current work
3. **Follow conventions**: AI suggestions will align with these established patterns

### Quick Reference

For quick lookup, each file is self-contained and can be read independently. Files are numbered to suggest a learning order, but can be referenced in any sequence.

### Updating Rules

When updating rules:

1. Keep each file focused on its specific topic
2. Update examples to match current code patterns
3. Add links to related files when concepts overlap
4. Maintain consistency in formatting and style

## Key Resources

- **Ergo.services**: [https://docs.ergo.services/](https://docs.ergo.services/)

  - [Actor Model Basics](https://docs.ergo.services/basics/actor-model)
  - [Supervisor Pattern](https://docs.ergo.services/actors/supervisor)
  - [Pool Pattern](https://docs.ergo.services/actors/pool)
  - [WebWorker](https://docs.ergo.services/actors/webworker)

- **Go Documentation**: [https://golang.org/doc/effective_go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go)

- **Project Documentation**:
  - [CONTRIBUTE.md](../../docs/CONTRIBUTE.md)
  - [SETUP.md](../../docs/SETUP.md)
  - [README.md](../../README.md)

## Contributing to Rules

If you find patterns that should be documented or rules that need updating:

1. Identify the appropriate file based on the topic
2. Add or update the pattern with clear examples
3. Ensure consistency with existing patterns
4. Submit a PR with changes to the rule files

**Remember**: These rules are here to help, not hinder. Use them as guidelines to maintain consistency and quality, but apply judgment when the situation calls for it.
