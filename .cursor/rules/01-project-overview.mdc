# Project Overview

FUSE (FUSE Utility for Stateful Events) is a flexible and extensible workflow engine built on the **ergo actor model** for creating end-to-end automations and task pipelines. Each node in a workflow operates as an independent actor, enabling isolated execution, message passing, supervision, and distributed scalability.

## Key Technologies

- **Go 1.24+** - Programming language
- **[ergo.services](https://docs.ergo.services/)** - Actor model framework
- **MongoDB** - Persistent storage
- **zerolog** - Structured logging
- **uber-go/fx** - Dependency injection
- **go-playground/validator** - Validation

## Core Concepts

### Actor Model Implementation

FUSE leverages the ergo actor model to provide:

- **Isolated Execution** - Each node runs as an independent actor
- **Message Passing** - Asynchronous communication between nodes
- **Supervision** - Built-in fault tolerance and recovery
- **State Management** - Actor-based state handling
- **Scalability** - Distributed execution capabilities

### Workflow Components

- **Node** - Fundamental building block that executes specific logic
- **Graph** - Collection of nodes and edges defining workflow structure
- **Edge** - Connection between nodes (conditional or unconditional)
- **Trigger Node** - Starting point of workflow execution
- **Thread Management** - Execution ordering through thread IDs

## Key Reference Files

- `.golangci.yml` - Linting configuration and enabled linters
- `docs/CONTRIBUTE.md` - Contribution guidelines and development workflow
- `internal/actors/*` - Actor implementations
- `internal/workflow/*` - Core workflow logic
- `internal/repositories/*` - Repository patterns
- `internal/handlers/*` - HTTP handler patterns
- `internal/services/*` - Service layer implementations
- `pkg/workflow/*` - Public workflow API
- `.specify/memory/constitution.md` - Project constitution and governing principles
- `.cursor/skills/` - Go senior developer skills and expertise

## Cursor Skills

Comprehensive Go senior developer skills are available in `.cursor/skills/`:

- `go-senior-developer/` - Go best practices, SOLID principles, clean code
- `microservices-architecture/` - Microservices patterns and practices
- `ddd-patterns/` - Domain-Driven Design patterns
- `clean-hexagonal-architecture/` - Clean and hexagonal architecture
- `cqrs-event-driven/` - CQRS and event-driven architecture
- `go-concurrency/` - Go concurrency patterns and best practices
- `actor-model-patterns/` - Actor model patterns with ergo.services

## Quality Gates

Mandatory quality gates enforce test-first development:

- **Lint** - Code must pass linting (`make lint`)
- **Build** - Code must compile (`make build`)
- **Test** - All tests must pass (`make test`)
- **Coverage** - Coverage thresholds must be met

See `.cursor/rules/12-quality-gates.mdc` for detailed requirements.

## Spec-Kit Integration

The project uses spec-kit for spec-driven development:

- `.specify/memory/constitution.md` - Project constitution
- `.specify/templates/` - Spec-kit templates
- `.specify/scripts/` - Spec-kit automation scripts
- `.cursor/commands/speckit.*` - Spec-kit slash commands

Use `/speckit.constitution`, `/speckit.specify`, `/speckit.plan`, `/speckit.tasks`, and `/speckit.implement` commands for structured development.

- [Actor Model Basics](https://docs.ergo.services/basics/actor-model)
- [Supervision Tree](https://docs.ergo.services/basics/supervision-tree)
- [Actor](https://docs.ergo.services/actors/actor)

- [Pool](https://docs.ergo.services/actors/pool)
- [WebWorker](https://docs.ergo.services/actors/webworker)
- [Testing](https://docs.ergo.services/testing/unit)

### Quick Reference

- All actors embed base types: `act.Actor`, `act.Supervisor`, `act.Pool`, or `act.WebWorker`
- Message passing is the primary communication mechanism
- Supervisors provide fault tolerance and recovery
- Pools manage worker actors for concurrent workloads
- WebWorkers handle HTTP requests as actors
- Network transparency enables distributed actor systems

---

**Remember:** This is an actor-based system. Think in terms of isolated processes communicating through messages, supervised for fault tolerance, and designed for distributed execution.
